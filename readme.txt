Awesome Hit Counter Provides Several Design Choices To Display The Total Number Of Hits Your WordPress Site Receives.

Once installed, the site owner can select one of ten hit counters to be displayed in the footer of the website. The location can be left, center, or right aligned. 

Every visit registers a new hit and the website owner can input a "starting" count as well. Switching to different counters will keep the count accurate and will not reset the counter.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wphitz.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
